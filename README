Building the Manual
===================

The manual is written using Sphinx [1] and hosted on ReadTheDocs [2]. We use
the ReadTheDocs theme [3] for pretty HTML output.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need to install the sphinx command in order to build the application. The
most convenient way to do this is using the pip command in a virtualenv
environment.  This section describes how to set this up.

First, install virtualenv:

    # sudo apt-get install virtualenv

Then, create a virtualenv environment:

    # virtualenv ~/local/virtualenv

Enable this environment:

     # . ~/local/virtualenv/bin/activate

Now, you can use pip for installing the packages described in
manual/requirements.txt into ~/local/virtualenv without affecting your global
Python installation:

    # pip install -r manual/requirements.txt

Create HTML Pages
-----------------

Now, create the HTML pages. The results can be found in manual/_build/html

    # cd manual
    # make html
